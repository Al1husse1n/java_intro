13. The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons according to how well you
play the game. You can redeem 10 coupons for a candy bar or 3 coupons for a gumball. You
prefer candy bars to gumballs. Write a program that defines a variable initially assigned to the
number of coupons you win. Next, the program should output how many candy bars and
gumballs you can get if you spend all of your coupons on candy bars first, and any remaining
coupons on gumballs.
14. Write a program that starts with the string variable first set to your first name and the string
variable last set to your last name. Both names should be all lowercase. Your program should
then create a new string that contains your full name in pig latin with the first letter capitalized for
the first and last name. Use only the pig latin rule of moving the first letter to the end of the word
and adding “ay.” Output the pig latin name to the screen. Use the substring and toUpperCase
methods to construct the new name.
For example, given
first = "walt"; last = "savitch";
the program should create a new string with the text “Altway Avitchsay” and print it.
